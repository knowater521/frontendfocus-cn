#### [The Cicada Principle, Revisited with CSS Variables](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91793/rss "lea.verou.me")

The _Cicada Principle_ is the idea that when creating repetitive patterns, backgrounds, etc. using prime numbers can increase the appearance of organic randomness. Lea shows how she used a modern approach to this idea to format her code examples in a visually striking way.

#### [Style Stage: A Modern CSS Showcase](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91794/rss "stylestage.dev")

A modern twist on the _CSS Zen Garden_ idea of yesteryear where people submit their own manipulations of a concept using the most modern of CSS features. Here are [the submissions so far](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91795/rss) with [Vaporwave](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91796/rss) being my favorite. They all have a very _“90s Web design renaissance”_ feel to them though.

Two of Google’s best known faces on the Chrome side of things give a twenty minute run through a whole bunch of new bits and pieces available in the DevTools in areas like performance monitoring, WebAssembly source mapping, and cookies.

*   I like this: A curated list of [whimsical websites](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91802/rss) that have a bit of fun and spark joy.

#### [A Basic Technique for Switching a Logo in Dark Mode](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91808/rss "www.giftegwuenu.com")

#### ['13% of My Website Visitors Block Google Analytics'](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91809/rss "markosaric.com")

It’s not just _ads_ that get blocked but trackers too. Every site will have a different audience profile and a different likelihood of having its tracking blocked, so maybe it’s better to track requests behind the scenes or focus on other metrics instead.

#### [Adding the `prefers-contrast` Media Query to Firefox](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91810/rss "hacks.mozilla.org")

This [upcoming media query](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91811/rss) works in a similar way to `prefers-colour-scheme`, and is to be used to detect if the user has requested the system increase or decrease the amount of contrast between adjacent colors. This blog post walks through its design and implementation in Firefox.

#### [Barebones WebGL in 75 Lines of Code](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91813/rss "avikdas.com")

WebGL is pretty intimidating but this boils it down to the bare essentials. And if you want to go further, I still think [this thorough guide](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91814/rss) is one of the best. Of course, you may see all of the boilerplate needed and just use [Three.js](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91815/rss) instead, which is fine too! 😄

#### [Headless WordPress with Gatsby Cloud](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91820/rss "www.gatsbyjs.org")

Gatsby is an increasingly popular React-based site building framework and this new plugin brings it to WordPress. The idea is you can use WordPress as a headless CMS with Gatsby taking care of the front-end.

#### [A Typing / Typewriter Effect in Pure CSS](https://frontendfoc.us/link/91824/rss "codepen.io")
